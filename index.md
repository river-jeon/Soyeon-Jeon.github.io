### Applying Unsupervised Summarization to YouTube Comments Regarding the Build Back Better Act

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised summarization technique employing a state-of-the-art opinion summarizer. With the goal of quickly obtaining a succinct aggregate of political media consumers' opinions, this paper modifies a previous work to incorporate substantive implementational changes to jointly consider: i) conflicting frames, ii) various aspects in the issue and iii) like count on each comment. This paper tests this modified design with user comments made on YouTube videos covering the Build Back Better Act. While the baseline model may have shown good performance on product reviews -- the data it had originally been trained on -- this paper finds that proposed model outperforms the baseline qualitatively. The paper also describes two of a three-part study, each detailing the three implementational improvements. This paper finds that the `likes' count could already exhibit positive effects on the opinion summarization performance, paving the way to an even more effective capturing method for the public reception of, political engagement in, and the general ambience surrounding a developing political issue on YouTube and similar media platforms.

### The Korean Voter in the Age of Deepfake: Measuring the Impact of Fake News with Big Data and Experiment 

This study is a political attempt to investigate and evaluate the effect of political polarization on voters' voting choices in a multidimensional manner. Social network usage patterns, sources of information, chances of deliberation in personal networks, ideology and other factors are considered as main variables. Through three rounds of panel analysis, we expect to observe the cause and contents of political polarization among Korean voters and how it affects the vote choice of the electorates. 


### Presidential TV debate 

Based on Affective Intelligence Theory (AIT), this research analyzes the 2022 Korean presidential TV debate. We plan to find out the informed effect and persuasion effect of the voters and synchronization of emotion between the candidates and the voters who watch the presidential TV debate.
